#Week 3 Update


## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I did a lot of research on how to get the title sources and image sources from any website through a chrome extension. I implemented a super rudamentary version of it and now have to parse the html.

## This Week's Plan
Since last week I have started on the title parsing. As of now there is no list as I have to handle titles at different
depths in HTML code. I also have to account for the ability for titles to be in an type of tag rather than the set I have
right now. Thus title parsing is ongoing and still in progress as of right now.

## Anything Blocking?
As expected parsing html tags is not necessarily the easiest thing especially for websites that have a lot going on.
