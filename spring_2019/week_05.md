#Week 5

## Last Week's Accomplishments
I finished my opsys homework :))). Regardless didn't get a chance to work on it before spring break.

## This Week's Plan
Made some more progress on filtering out the images and titles. Titles are basically done but images again don't always have
an exact tag depth or name associated with them. Still working on filtering that. Going to see if I can find an open source
project that does that and take some inspiration from that. So far so good.

## Anything Blocking?
Time to go back and look at the images. Scared and excited to get it done :(
