#Week 7

## Last Week's Accomplishments
Finished the ability to highlight text and retrieve that from the website 

## This Week's Plan
Help Karthik with his API and finishing up the machine learning model. Hopefully we can put it all together and finish. I also want to add some stuff to the contentscript so that we can change the view of the website based on the results from the python back end.

## Anything Blocking?
Nope.

## Notes
Google has lots of cool addons for chrome extensions to make it surprisingly easy to develop one.
