#Week 3 Update
Since last week I have started on the title parsing. As of now there is no list as I have to handle titles at different
depths in HTML code. I also have to account for the ability for titles to be in an type of tag rather than the set I have
right now. Thus title parsing is ongoing and still in progress as of right now.
