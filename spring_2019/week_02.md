#Week 2 Status Update
So this week I was very busy with studying so I wasn't able to work too much on the chrome extension. However I
did do a good amount of research and experimenting with getting picture sourcs and reading for titles. So I have created a
very rudamentary app that can display picture sources and titles within the web page's source html. However that is it so far. I
wanted to be able to already have a list of pictures and titles but right now I haven't done the parsing. A goal for next week
would be to have an app that displays TITLES: with a list of article titles, and PICTURES: with a list of source links that
the pictures came from.
