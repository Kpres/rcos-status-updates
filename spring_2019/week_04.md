#Week 4

## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I did some work on parsing titles and images and did not get to far as I was getting blocked by the ability for images to basically be anywhere and at any depth.

## This Week's Plan
I was very busy before spring break with exams etc and finishing up opsys homework. With that
in mind I didnt get any time to work on the chrome extension so far but the week after spring break will be good to start back
up again on it!

## Anything Blocking?
Still the images maybe I should try titles first.
