#Week 9

## Last Week's Accomplishments
Practice presentation timing and completed. Very close to finishing the API.

## This Week's Plan
I have to do an overhaul of the front end of the web app so that it is presentation ready and that the results of the 
ML backend looks good and is understanding.

## Anything Blocking?
Nope.

## Notes
None
