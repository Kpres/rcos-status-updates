#Week 6

## Last Week's Accomplishments
I finally finished images!!! Took forever. 

## This Week's Plan
After figuring out titles, I realized that every single news website has a different way of posting headlines. It is the headlines that we want no just the title. So in order to do so I think I am going to switch it so that whatever I highlight or select will be run through the back end to determine the click baityness.

## Anything Blocking?
Nope not yet. Just gotta figure out how to get highlighted text.
