#Week 11 WE MADE IT

## Last Week's Accomplishments
API is almost done! Also started work on the content script that will change the color of text and highlights on the current
page

## This Week's Plan
Over the summer I will be doing a big front end change to everything. New chrome extension look as well as the content script
should come as close to material UI as possible ( google design theme)

## Anything Blocking?
Nope.

## Notes
None
